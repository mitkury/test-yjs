# AI Workspace

## Active Task
a very simple example of using yjs where we have two peers that exchange updates. Let's use sveltekit and allow to have a collaborative session where I will use two browser tabs to sync changes. Add offline mode functionality. Add visualization of true delta updates with size metrics. Implement rich text editing with Quill.

## Status
âœ… Completed

## Context & Progress
- Created: 2025-04-19
- I (AI) will maintain this document as we work together
- Completed the implementation of a collaborative text editor using Yjs and SvelteKit
- Added offline mode functionality to allow pausing and resuming synchronization
- Added visualization of document updates with a history log
- Enhanced update visualization with size metrics for each change
- Improved to show actual delta changes rather than full document states
- Integrated Quill rich text editor for formatted collaborative editing

## Task History
- Initial task: a very simple example of using yjs where we have two peers that exchange updates. Let's use sveltekit and allow to have a collaborative session where I will use two browser tabs to sync changes
- Implemented a collaborative text editor using Yjs and SvelteKit
- Created components for displaying active collaborators
- Set up real-time synchronization between browser tabs using a demo WebSocket server
- Added offline mode with pause/resume sync functionality to test offline editing scenarios
- Added update visualization to display a history of document changes
- Enhanced the update visualization with size metrics to show data volume for each change
- Refactored to track and display true delta updates instead of full document states
- Replaced the simple textarea with a Quill rich text editor for formatted content

## Implementation Details
- Used SvelteKit as the framework
- Implemented Yjs for conflict-free data synchronization
- Used y-websocket to connect to a demo server for WebSocket communication
- Added awareness features to show active collaborators
- Created a clean, responsive UI for the collaborative editor
- Implemented offline mode to pause/resume synchronization
- Added visual indicators for offline users
- Added pending changes tracking for offline edits
- Created a history view that shows document updates and attempts to highlight changes
- Implemented size metrics for updates, showing document size and size deltas between updates
- Enhanced to extract and display only the changed parts (deltas) from each update
- Added operation type information (insert, delete, mixed) for each change
- Displayed position and length information to understand where changes occur
- Integrated Quill rich text editor with y-quill binding
- Added text formatting capabilities (bold, italic, headers, lists, etc.)

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the yjs-example directory
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Open the application in multiple browser tabs to test collaboration

## Notes
- The application syncs text changes in real-time across multiple browser tabs
- Users can see who is currently connected and editing
- For production use, a dedicated WebSocket server should be set up
- Offline mode allows users to work without an internet connection and sync changes later
- Visual indicators clearly show which users are offline
- Update history shows both local and remote changes, with timestamps and user info
- Size metrics help understand the data volume being exchanged in each update
- Delta visualization shows only what changed rather than entire document state
- Rich text formatting is synchronized between users in real-time
